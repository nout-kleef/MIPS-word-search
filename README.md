# MIPS-word-search

C and MIPS assembly implementation of a word search puzzle. Made to serve as an implementation for the Intro to Computer Systems coursework 1.

The goal was to write three programs - both in MIPS assembly language and in C - that can identify all dictionary words in a 1) 1-dimensional grid, 2) 2-dimensional grid and 3) 2-dimensional grid with wraparounds (see image), respectively.
